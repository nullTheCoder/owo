# Owo

## Using this shit
To use this script you need:
  1. Any texturepack
  2. Python 3 with PIL (if it works with py2, that is great!)
  
So, you need to unarchive resourcepack to folder with script, rename it's folder to "input" and run:

`python main.py`

Enjoy! (If you found bug, please notify us)
